## üßπ 2. Step 1: Data Cleaning

Data cleaning ensures data quality, consistency, and reliability for analysis.  
The following steps were applied:

- **Handling Missing Values:**  
  - Identified missing values across all columns.  
  - Applied appropriate strategies (drop or impute) depending on data importance.

- **Text Standardization:**  
  - Unified categorical values (e.g., `Yes` / `No`) and removed extra spaces.  
  - Normalized text casing.

- **Duplicate Removal:**  
  - Checked for duplicate records and removed them to avoid redundancy.

- **Data Type Conversion:**  
  - Converted numeric columns like `HeightInMeters`, `WeightInKilograms`, `BMI`, and health day counts to numeric types.  
  - Converted categorical variables to `category` type for optimization.

- **Inconsistency Check:**  
  - Fixed inconsistent values and ensured standardized labels across categorical fields.

## üìà 3. Step 2: Data Visualization & Preprocessing

### üñºÔ∏è Data Visualization

To understand the data distribution and detect hidden patterns:

- Plotted the **distribution of heart-related conditions** (`HadHeartAttack`, `HadAngina`, etc.).  
- Explored relationships between **BMI**, **AgeCategory**, and **Sex** with heart disease indicators.  
- Visualized **vaccination**, **smoking**, and **alcohol habits** impact on health indicators.  
- Detected outliers in numerical features (`BMI`, `SleepHours`, `PhysicalHealthDays`) using boxplots.  
- Checked data balance for key target variables.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

Prepared the dataset for modeling:

- **Encoding:**  
  - Transformed categorical columns into numeric format using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

- **Scaling:**  
  - Standardized numerical columns to improve model performance.

- **Balancing:**  
  - Addressed class imbalance for target features like `HadHeartAttack` if necessary.

- **Splitting:**  
  - Divided data into training and testing sets for future predictive modeling.
